## Running

First, you need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed.

To update locally installed dependencies, run `npm install`. This needs to be run at least once
before the project can be run locally.

To run the local dev server, `npm run dev`. This will run the dev server on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
